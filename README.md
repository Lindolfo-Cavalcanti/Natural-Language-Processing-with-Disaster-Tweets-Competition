# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.

## Introduction

In this competition, we are given a dataset of tweets and tasked with predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster (target = 1) or not (target = 0). This is a binary classification problem in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data). It includes the following files:

- `train.csv`: The training dataset containing tweets and their corresponding labels.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset for which we need to predict the labels.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file in the correct format.
